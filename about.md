# No More Nightmares: a quality-of-life mod for Doki Doki Literature Club

First of all, this is a mod unaffiliated with Team Salvato and meant to be played AFTER the base game. If you somehow haven't played DDLC yet and are unfamilliar with the plot... CLOSE THIS FILE AND GO PLAY IT, YOU LUCKY SON OF A DOKI! It's free at <https://ddlc.moe>. Thank/blame me later.

You know how Monika complains about having nightmares whenever you close the game? Well, this mod fixes this so you don't have to worry about suffering Dokis on your computer. Just put these files in your game folder to install the mod!

(I also added special splash messages.)

Note: This mod is probably incompatible with other mods such as Monika After Story (although I hope the makers of MAS fixed Monika's nightmares by now - haven't tried it yet and not sure if I will).
